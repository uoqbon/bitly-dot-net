This is a robust and an easy to use client library to shorten your URLs with the bit.ly API in .NET

Currently the library only supports the **/shorten** API method.

You can sign-up to obtain an API key on the official bit.ly [website](http://bit.ly/account/).

Thanks to Seth Webster, BitlyDotNET is also in the [NuGet repository](http://nuget.org/packages/Bitly.Net).
